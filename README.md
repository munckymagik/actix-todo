# actix-todo

A port of the [Rocket Todo example](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/tree/master/examples/todo) into [actix-web](https://actix.rs/) for the sake of comparison.

This probably isn't very idiomatic actix code yet. I will probably ask for some feedback from someone in the actix
community at some point.
